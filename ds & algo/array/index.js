What is array in javascript ?

In JavaScript, an array is a data structure used to store a collection of values.
These values can be of any data type, including numbers, strings, objects, functions, and even other arrays.

Technique	Used For
Hash Map / Set	Lookup, Duplicates, Frequencies
Two Pointers	Sorted arrays, Partitioning, Palindromes
Sliding Window	Subarrays, Maximum/Minimum in window
Prefix Sum	Range sums, Subarray problems
Binary Search	Sorted arrays, Rotated arrays, Searching answers
Sorting	Greedy algorithms, Grouping
Stack	Next Greater Element, Monotonic Stack patterns
Kadane’s Algo	Max subarray problems
Greedy	Max profit, Choosing elements
Backtracking	Subsets, Permutations
Dynamic Programming	Complex subproblems with overlapping solutions


🗂️ 3. How to Structure Array Problems
Group them like this in your study plan:

🎯 By Problem Type
Searching: Binary search, Rotated array

Counting: Frequency, Duplicates

Subarray: Max sum, Equal sum, Product

Rearrangement: Move zeroes, Sort colors

Range Query: Prefix sum, Sliding window

Greedy choice: Stock buy/sell, Jump game
